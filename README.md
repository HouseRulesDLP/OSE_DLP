# Old School Essentials (OSE) Netizlla's House Rules
This is a fork of the [Old School Essentials Markdown](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/Old-School-Essentials-Markdown) project with the addition of the rules from the Advanced OSE rules plus my own house rules.

With permission from [@OldManUmby](https://github.com/OldManUmby/OSE.SRD.Wiki), a copy of his OSE SRD wiki is held here so that we may also host homebrew items, and expend this resource into a more advanced Obsidian Vault. 

## How to use
1. Clone, Fork, or Download this repository as a zip.
2. Open the folder in Obsidian.
3. Profit, for now.

## What's Different?
- Incorporation of the Old School Essentials Advanced Expansion ([player](https://necroticgnome.com/products/old-school-essentials-advanced-fantasy-players-tome) and [referee](https://necroticgnome.com/products/old-school-essentials-advanced-fantasy-referees-tome)) rules.
- Countdown Pools
- Alternate Saving Throw Names
- A skill and ability check system inspired by [Hyperborea 3rd Edition](https://www.hyperborea.tv/).
- An Advantage/Disadvantage system similar to those founds in many other d20 games.
- Traits (similar to Feats in other systems).
- Fortune Points (a meta-currency representing the role of fate in your character's life).

## Citations
In may places, there are references to official rules documents and some third-party books.  Here is a list of abbreviations used for those references:
