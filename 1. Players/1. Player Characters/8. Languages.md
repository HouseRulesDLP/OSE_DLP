# `=this.file.name`
Most characters begin play knowing both their native tongue (determined by their culture) the common parlance of the home region. Characters with high INT may learn additional languages (see ***[[5. Ability Scores#Intelligence (INT)|Intelligence]]***).  Characters with low INT may only speak their native language (and possibly not well) and may also be illiterate.

## The Common Tongue
The common tongue (sometimes simply called ***Common***) is whatever language is widespread among intelligent species in a given region. Unless they are of particularly low intelligence, all player characters and most NPCs will speak the local common tongue.

## Alignment Languages
These are not being used.

## Other Languages
Most intelligent species have their own language, which player characters may be able to learn. The following languages are common and may be chosen by player characters with high Intelligence (at the referee’s discretion):
