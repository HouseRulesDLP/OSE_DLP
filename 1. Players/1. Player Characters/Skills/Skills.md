# Skills


## When to Check
Skill checks are only needed if there is a meaningful chance and consequence to failure.  Under normal circumstances with no real danger and plenty of time, it's best to assume the check simply succeeds.  However, the GM may be justified in calling for a check just to assess the quality of the result and how long it takes.

## Retrying Skills
Normally, one cannot retry a failed skill roll.  Once it has failed, all further attempts will automatically fail.  However, there are a few exceptions:
- The character has advanced a level since their last attempt.
- The character has improved their circumstances; either gaining [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Advantage]] where they didn't have it before, or removing [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] from a check.
- The GM determines that it is reasonable for a skill to be re-tried.  For example, someone falling out of a tree would, under normal circumstances, be fully warranted in getting up and trying to climb it again.  On the other hand, if someone searches a room a fails to find anything, all further searches will be fruitless unless the character does something to improve their odds.
