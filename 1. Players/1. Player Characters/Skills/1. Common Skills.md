## %%Common Skills%%
These skills are common to all adventurers as there are some things you can't help but pick up as you spend your time wandering the wilderness and delving dungeons.

## %%Climb%%
The ability to climb a vertical surface with reasonable hand-holds (such as a tree, rocky cliff or a rope).  No roll is required for things like ladders.  One check is required for every 100 feet climbed with a failure indicating a fall from the mid-point of that segment.  Climbing speed is 1/4 normal ground speed.
