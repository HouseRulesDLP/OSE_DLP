# `=this.file.name`
A character’s class is assumed to be their primary profession and the focus of all training. 

This optional rule grants characters a small degree of experience in an additional profession—called a background (or secondary) skill—which they have picked up at some point in their lives. This may be the profession of a parent or mentor which the character has picked up to some degree or it may be simply a skill that the character practices as a hobby.[^1]

## Determining Background
When creating a new character, the player should roll d100 and consult the table below to determine the character’s secondary skill. If desired, the referee may allow a player to choose a secondary skill rather than rolling randomly.

## Using Background Skills
The referee must adjudicate all uses of background skills. Generally speaking, knowledge of a background skill allows a character to perform the functions of a profession at a basic level, for example:
- Assess the value and quality of an item associated with the skill. 
- Make minor repairs to items associated with the skill. 
- Construct simple items associated with the skill.
- You have a base 6:12 chance to succeed when a background skill test is called for.  This does not normally improve (though see the XXX [[Trait]]).
- In instances where a [[3. Character Classes|Class]] and background skill both apply, you gain [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Advantage]] on the class skill check.

Under no circumstances can a character following the life of an adventurer match the skill level of someone dedicated to a profession.
