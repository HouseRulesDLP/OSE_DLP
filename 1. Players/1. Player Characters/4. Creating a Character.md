To create a character, you’ll first need a character sheet—a sheet of paper on which to record all information about the new character.

A selection of different character sheet PDFs is available at necroticgnome.com. These may be downloaded and printed for use in your games.

We will be following the **Advanced Method**[^1] of character creation with a few tweaks.

## 1. Roll Ability Scores
We will be adopting the [[BARFLIP Worksheet Landscape.pdf|BARFLIP]] method for rolling ability scores.  We will not be using the 'automatic 6' option at the bottom-left of the document.[^2]

## 2. Choose a Species
Select one of the available [[2. Character Species|species]], bearing in mind the minimum ability score requirements of some. Ability score modifiers: If the selected species lists ability score modifiers, adjust your character’s ability scores as indicated. These modifiers cannot raise an ability score above 18 or lower it below 3.[^3]

## 3. Choose a Class
Select one of the classes available (see ***[[3. Character Classes|Character Classes]]***), bearing in mind some classes' minimum ability score requirements.[^4]

## 4. Adjust Ability Scores
If you wish, you may raise your character’s *prime requisite* by lowering other (non-prime requisite) ability scores. One point may be added to a prime requisite for every two points by which an ability score is reduced. The following restrictions apply:

- Charisma may **not** be lowered in this way.
- No score may be lowered below 9.
- Some character classes may have additional constraints.[^5]

## 5. Note Ability Score Modifiers
Now that your character’s ability scores are fixed, note any associated bonuses or penalties (see ***[[5. Ability Scores|Ability Scores]]***).[^6]

## 6. Note Attack Values
The level progression chart for your character’s class lists your Attack Bonus. This indicates your character's bonus to hitting opponents in [[10. Combat|Combat]].[^7]

## 7. Note Saving Throws and Class Abilities
Record any special abilities possessed by your character as a result of their class, as well as your character’s saving throws. If your character has a spell book, ask your referee which spells are recorded. The referee may allow you to choose.[^8]

## 8. Starting Hit Points
Your character starts play with the maximum possible number of hit points based on their Hit Die and Constitution Modifier (this can never be less than 1).[^9]

## 9. Choose Goals and Passions
Decide on your characters [[6. Goals and Passions|goals and passions]].  This replaces alignment.[^10]

## 10. Note Known Languages
Your character’s native languages are listed in the species description. This includes the common tongue—see ***[[8. Languages|Languages]]***.  There are no alignment languages. Characters with high INT may also choose additional languages from the list available in the setting.[^11]

## 11. Buy Equipment
Your class and secondary skill (aka background) will determine your starting [[1. Wealth|wealth]]. You may choose to sell back your starting equipment for half it's purchase value (due to be used).  You may spend as much of this money as you wish to equip your character for adventure, consulting the equipment lists under ***[[5. Equipment|Equipment & Services]]***.

**Remember:** Your chosen class may restrict your use of some equipment (e.g., weapons and armor).[^12]

## 12. Note Armor Class
Two factors determine your character’s Armor Class:

- **Armor:** The armor worn determines your character’s base AC. See the equipment lists under ***[[3. Weapons and Armor#Armor|Armor]]***.
- **Dexterity:** A nimble character is more difficult to attack (see ***Dexterity*** under ***[[5. Ability Scores|Ability Scores]]***).

### Unarmored AC
If your character has no armor, their base AC is 10.[^13]

## 13. Note Level and XP
Your character begins play at 1st level with 0 XP.[^14]

## 14. Name Character
Finally, choose a name for your character. You are now ready for adventure!
