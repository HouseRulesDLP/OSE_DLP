- **Time:** 
- **Retrying:** 
- **Natural 1:** 
- **After Level 10:** 

###### %%Battle Mastery%%
Once per turn, when you make a melee attack, you may attempt a [[Battle Maneuver]]. If the attack hits and the [[Natural Value]] of your Attack Roll is equal to or greater than your Battle Mastery target number (on the table below), the maneuver succeeds. Many maneuvers, however, do allow the target to make a Saving Throw.
- **After Level 10:** You may attempt even more outrageous and daring combat stunts (such as slicing the buckles of a foe's armor to leave them unarmored or )

###### %%Brew Potion%%

- **After Level 10:** 

###### %%Climb Wall%%
To ascend or descend sheer cliffs or walls without need of climbing gear. If vertical, the surface must be rough or cracked. At least one check must be made per 100 feet of climbing. Failure indicates the climber has slipped and fallen at about the midpoint of the check and will suffer falling damage.  Climbing speed is 1/4 normal ground speed.
- **Retrying:** The character may immediately retry a failed climb attempt but must start over from the point to which they fell.
- **After Level 10:** This characters ability to climb becomes praeternatural and may climb surfaces that are nearly smooth as well as being able to climb surfaces beyond vertical (such as crawling along a ceiling).  Additionally, their climb speed increases to 1/2 normal walking speed.

###### %%Damage Dealer%%
Add the damage shown in the **Damage Bonus** column of table below to your weapon attacks.
- **After Level 10:** 

###### %%Decipher%%
A successful check allows this character to understand the gist of a non-magical text in a language they do not speak, unravel a cipher, or identify cryptically labelled landmarks on a map.
- **Time:** Time depends on the length of the text to be deciphered.
- **Retrying:** Only one attempt to read a document may be made unless some means of improving the odds are discovered or a new character level has been reached.
- **Natural 1:** On a roll of natural 1, the character is convinced that their translation is correct, though it definitely is not.
- **After Level 10:** Magical texts and ciphers may be attempted, but at [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Disadvantage]].  Arcane spell scrolls decoded in this way may be used as if this character were the proper spellcasting class, however, this requires a second check (without disadvantage) at a penalty equal to the spell's tier.  Failure may result in a [[9. Magic|mishap]].

###### %%Disguise%%
Characters of any class may don disguises, but this character is a master of the art— able to create disguises that pass even close scrutiny.  The character may appear up to 5% taller or shorter and up to 10% lighter or heavier (but must remain within the same [[size category]]).  They may also appear as a different sex or species (at [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] if the chosen species is significantly different, such as a human attempting to appear as a [[lizard-folk]]).

**After Level 10:** This character can change their appearance so radically as to be able to change their apparent size category by 1 full step, and may even assume appearances of radically different species (like a humanoid attempting to appear as a non-humanoid creature).  Such attempts are made at [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Disadvantage]], but the disadvantage for less extreme differences is removed.

###### %%Enchant Item%%

###### %%Glancing Blows%%
This character is an expert at dealing damage. If their attack misses the target's AC by the amount shown on the table below or less, you still deal your attack's minimum damage to the target.
- **After Level 10:** Your minimum damage increases from 1 per die to 2 per die.

###### %%Hauler%%
Add your Constitution Modifier (if positive) to your Strength Score for calculating your Readied and Stowed limits.
- **After Level 10:** Double your Constitution Modifier for the purposes of this ability.

###### %%Leadership%%
This character inspires great loyalty and all pay heed to what they say.  They increase their [[5. Ability Scores#Charisma (CHA)|maximum number of henchmen]] by 1.  Also, the base morale score of anyone serving under this character (including citizens and soldiers of their domain if they rule one) is increased by 1.  If any of your allies lose morale or becomes [[Frightened]], you may attempt to **Rally** them using this skill, so long as you are within 30 feet and they can perceive you.  On a successful check, NPC morale is restored and the Frightened condition is removed.
- **After Level 10:** All your allies' roles for morale or resisting fear are made with [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Advantage]] so long as they are within 30 feet and can perceive you.  Additionally, you gain [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Advantage]] on rolls to Rally your allies.

###### %%Legerdemain%%
A successful check allows a this character to perform a trick of sleight of hand, such as palming a small object, slipping a poison into a drink, or pilfering a small item in the possession of another creature.  Using this ability is typically an opposed check between this skill and the target's Perception (WIL).
- **Retrying:** Retries may be attempted as often as desired, but performing the same trick in front of the same observers imposes [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on this check.
- **Fail by Half:** On a roll less than half this skill's target number (round down), the target spots the attempt.  The target makes a Reaction Roll at [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Disadvantage]].  Other observers may also spot the attempt if the roll is low enough.
- **After Level 10:** This character has cultivated multiple cunning hiding places about their person.  As a result, anyone searching for concealed items on them, makes their search with [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Disadvantage]].  Additionally all the extra pockets, pouches and the like gives the character an extra 2 slots of stowed gear.

###### %%Lore (military)%%
This character is well versed in military matters.  They can automatically identify the heraldry, equipment, famous warriors, military jargon and rank insignia of their homeland.  Identifying those of other lands may be accomplished with a 7+ on a d12 (modified by Intelligence).
- **Retrying:**  Additional attempts may only be made after the character has either gained a new level or found some means by which to improve their odds.
- **Natural 1:** The character is convinced that they've successfully identified whatever it is they are viewing.  Unfortunately, they're wrong.
- **After Level 10:** 

###### %%Open Locks%%
To pick locks or disable latching mechanisms of a non-magical nature. Thieves’ tools are required. 
- **Time:** Each attempt to pick a lock requires 1 Turn.
- **Retrying:** Additional attempts may only be made after the character has either gained a new level or found some means by which to improve their odds.
- **Natural 1:** On a roll of natural 1, the character accidentally jams the lock with their tools.
- **After Level 10:** Magical locks may be picked, but the roll is made at [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Disadvantage]].

###### %%Perception%%
This character is specifically trained to watch for guards and hunt for hidden treasures and traps.
- **Time:** It takes a minimum of 1 [[Turn]] to search a 10ft x 10ft x 10ft area or a Large or bigger object.  Medium or smaller objects take at least 1 minute to search.  Other uses of perception typically take no more than 1 round.
- **Retrying:** Additional perception or search attempts may only be made after the character has either gained a new level or found some means by which to improve their odds.
- **After Level 10:** Searches only take 1/2 the normal time.  Additionally, your senses become so sharp that you gain Tremorsense out to 10 feet.

###### %%Poison%%
This character is trained in the brewing of a great variety of [[poisons]] (and their antidotes).  This only applies to non-magical poisons.   Victims of a [[Poison|poisoning]] by this character suffer [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] to the saving throw.  Frequent exposure to poisons grant the assassin [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Advantage]] on all saving throws and ability checks to resist poisons.
- **Time:** It takes a minimum of 1 [[Watch]] to brew a poison assuming all the ingredients are already on-hand.
- **Retrying:** A failed attempt ruins the poison and its ingredients and the character must start over again from scratch.
- **Natural 1:** On a roll of natural 1, the character gets poisoned and loses the batch.
- **After Level 10:** Magical poisons may be brewed, but the roll is made at [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] unless this character has the assistance of a spellcaster.

###### %%Sense Magic%%
Being sensitive to the world of magic, a Mage may determine if a person, place or thing is magical. Doing so requires [[Concentration]] and a full minute; so they cannot tell if something is magical simply by being in its presence and people tend to notice when a spellcaster is staring at them. After 1 minute of concentration, the Mage may make a Arcana (WIS) check to determine if something is magical, and (possibly) the nature of the magic. On a success, the character learns whether or not magic is present and its general type.
- **Time:** 1 minute
- **Retrying:** Additional attempts may only be made after the character has either gained a new level or found some means by which to improve their odds.
- **Natural 1:** The mage opens their senses too much and they loose access to this ability until they complete a [[Long Rest]].
- **Referee Rolls:** The Referee rolls all Detect Magic Checks, so that players do not know if the roll failed or if there is no magic present.
- **After Level 10:** Your senses have become so attuned to magic that this ability becomes a passive instant ability that does not require a roll.  You simply know something is magical.  However, one Round of study and an Arcana (WIS) check (at [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Advantage]]) is still required to determine the nature of the magic.

###### %%Spellcasting%%
You have the ability to cast [[arcane]] spells.

#### Spellcasting Focus
As part of their apprenticeship, Mages create a device to aid in casting spells. This focus may take most any form (a staff, wand, amulet or similar), but must be easily seen, recognized and hand-held. It also takes up 1 Inventory Slot. A focus may be replaced by constructing a new one which takes 1 week in a [[Safe Haven]] and 100 sp worth of materials.

For every level the Mage has, they may carve a sigil into their focus. Each sigil represents a specific spell the Mage has learned (i.e. recorded in their [[Spellbook]]). Whenever they cast one of these spells, while holding their Magical Focus, the player rolls d8s for their Invocation Dice instead of d6s. It takes 1 Day times the spell's Tier and 50 sp per Day to engrave a new sigil into a focus.

Having a Magical Focus in hand does not count against needing a free hand for spell casting.

#### Invocation Dice
As arcane casters, Mages have the number of invocation dice indicated on the table below, plus a number of additional dice equal to their [[5. Ability Scores#Wisdom (WIS)|Wisdom modifier]]. The Mage may choose how many dice to roll each time they attempt to cast a spell.

#### Spell Preparation
Mages record their spells in their [[spellbooks]] as arcane formulae. Before a spell can be cast, however, it must be prepared. The table below shows the number of spells of each level they may prepare after a [[Long Rest]]. This takes 10 uninterrupted minutes times the Rank of the spell, during which the character may take no other actions.

#### Blood Magic
If an invocation roll is failed, a mage may choose to sacrifice Hit Points to increase their invocation roll.  Each 1 HP sacrificed increases the roll by 1 point.

#### Arcane Tradition
A Mage must select an [[Arcane Tradition]]. This will determine which spells they have access to. See the rules on [[Arcane Magic]] for details.

###### %%Sneak Attack%%
When this character has *Advantage* on an attack, add the listed damage on the table below to the attack.  This ability will not work against targets immune to critical hits (like many undead and oozes) nor against targets more than 1 size category larger or smaller than the attacker.

###### %%Stealth%%
**Hiding:** This character may make a Stealth Check to remain undetected when shadows are the only cover available.
**Sneaking:** If a [[Surprise Roll]] indicates that a thief’s party has been detected, the thief may make a Stealth Check to remain undetected.
Movement while using stealth is halved.
- **After Level 10:** The character becomes effectively invisible to both sight and sound while hiding.  They may also move full speed while sneaking.

###### %%Tactics%%
You are well-versed in assessing the battlefield and how best to position yourself and your comrades to best advantage.  So long as your allies are within 30 feet and can both see an hear you, they gain a +1 on their [[Initiative]] roll.  Additionally, you can roll this check to spot likely ambush spots, kill zones and the like, as well as assess the like combat capabilities of an enemy force (whether or not it's less, equal or greater than your own force).
- **Time:** Assessing an enemy force or surveying a potential battlefield may take anywhere from several minutes to several [[Exploration Turns]].
- **Retrying:** Additional attempts may only be made after the character has either gained a new level or found some means by which to improve their odds.
- **Natural 1:** You are convinced you completely understand whatever it is you are assessing (be it an enemy force or potential battlefield).  However, there will be something you have overlooked.
- **After Level 10:** Instead of gaining +1 to their initiative, your allies roll initiative with Advantage (the same conditions apply).  

###### %%Traps%%
To remove, set, or reset complex, clockwork-like traps. Separate checks must be made to accomplish each facet of this skill: set, remove, reset.  Also, a new trap may be built if the mechanism is simple and the parts available; anything more complex requires the assistance of an engineer. Thieves’ tools are required when practicing this ability.
- **Time:** Each attempt to disarm a trap requires 1 Turn.
- **Retrying:** Additional attempts may only be made after the character has either gained a new level or found some means by which to improve their odds.
- **Natural 1:** On a roll of natural 1, the character accidentally springs the trap.
- **After Level 10:** Magical traps may be disarmed, but the roll is made at [[3d. Advantage and Disadvantage|Disadvantage]].  Setting or resetting a magical trap requires the assistance of a spellcaster.

###### %%Weapon Specialization%%
Select 1 specific weapon type (such as Battle Axe, Long Bow, Arming Sword, etc.) You gain +1 To Hit and the damage bonus listed in the **Specialized Damage Bonus** column of the table below. This replaces the normal **Damage Bonus**.
